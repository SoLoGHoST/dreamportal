# DreamPortal
Dream Portal is a CMS for the forum software SMF (Simple Machines Forum).

As the goal of any portal system, which is to allow you to easily manage your site and webpages, Dream Portal offers many tools to help streamline this using AJAX, Javascript, jQuery, and other recent technologies. Dream Portal allows you to take advantage of placing Modules (or blocks of information) on different actions and non-actions of your SMF forum and is easily configurable, using a simple drag-and-drop placing method for the different modules that provides a WYSIWYG environment. Dream Portal allows a user to display all the desired information with very little effort.

Users can also create and save multiple layouts by name, allowing use of different layouts for different membergroups, users, or simply the ability to change between several different configurations at will. Dream Pages offers the ability to create your own PHP, HTML, or BBC pages that link directly into SMF. Dream Menu offers the ability to create, manage, and order your Menu Item buttons within SMF.

In short, Dream Portal allows you the ability to easily customize your SMF forum and site with many different possibilities using streamlined web technologies that make customization a breeze.
